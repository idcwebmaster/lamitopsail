Our TopSail Youth Program is offered year-round, <i>free of charge</i> to students from under-resourced schools <em>and</em> youth organizations in San Pedro and Wilmington, and throughout the Greater Los Angeles Area.¬† Since our founding in 1992, we have served more than 50,000 at-risk youth in underserved communities throughout Los Angeles County.

Our "no cost" program is offered to Title I upper elementary, middle and high schools as well as youth groups located within the 15 council districts of the City of Los Angeles, and is made possible by generous financial support from the Port of Los Angeles, a TopSail program sponsor for more than a decade.

Our "reduced cost" program is offered to any school or youth group with limited ability to pay, thanks to the support of corporate sponsors, foundations and individual donors.¬† In addition, any revenue earned from public sails, fundraising events or private bookings goes back into our program.

Since our inception, our goal has been to never be in port when we ought to be at sea, to never turn a kid away for lack of money, and to never sail with an empty berth.

<em>We hope you will partner with us in our mission to provide educational, transformational experiences at sea for all of LA's Youth!¬† Please donate today and help keep our program afloat.¬† Remember...¬†</em>

<em><strong>Excerpt from Tall Ships America</strong></em>

A ship at sea has been described as a microcosm of the planet. Resources are finite, waste must be managed responsibly and success depends on one's ability to work as a team. One quickly learns that many hands lighten a load. In a similar way, so do good shipmates -- those who are focused, considerate, and good humored. There is no place on earth which better illuminates leadership qualities, nor marks the path so clearly toward achieving them. The rewards of a smoothly run ship are immediate, obvious and sweetly satisfying. As sailors have said for centuries, take care of your ship and she'll take care of you.

There is no better feeling in the world than coming off an early morning watch having watched the sun rise and helped to scrub everything down for the start of a new day. As you leave the ship in the hands of the next watch you realize how happy you are to see them -- and even happier to leave them to it - as you go below for the sort of breakfast you'd never eat ashore and a grateful climb into a narrow berth assuming any angle of heel. Adjusting to sleeping when you can is strangely easy, and you find yourself sleeping easily in your bunk no matter what the time of day or the weather (well, with the occasional notable exception!). You find yourself frequently aware of living completely in the moment, and you take great pride in accomplishing tasks and seeking new challenges for yourself.

Aboard a sail training vessel, as in life, our small piece is a critical part of the whole. The quality of work, and the spirit in which we do it, has a profound effect on the well-being of everyone else aboard. Leadership, paradoxically, is arrived at by learning to take direction. Becoming a team player. Pulling your share of the load. Being absolutely responsible. Dependable. And, learning to depend on the responsibility of others. For no matter what the particular mission of a ship might be, it is essential that she be safely navigated and handsomely attended.

This is true of the larger world, but in the larger world, the quality of our actions are not so immediately apparent. In our day to day lives, most of us do not have at hand accessible evidence of collisions we've safely avoided, environmental conditions we gained advantage from, or courses accurately steered no matter the conditions. Our actions seem at times to be in a vacuum and feedback is often butted by other issues. It often takes years to measure the efficacy of our navigation and our ability to "hand, reef and steer" our lives. Nor do we often have the simple yet somehow completely thrilling affirmation of perfectly set sails in a stiff breeze and a ship "with a bone in her teeth." On a sail training vessel, it's right there. Right now.

For some, sail training offers first time successes. For others, it is a much needed refresher course in life when we find ourselves, for instance, knocking hats off passerby's or staring too long at funeral processions -- which Herman Melville describes as "high time to get to sea" in Moby Dick. For all, sail training offers an absolutely unique experience.

The idea for the Institute was formed several years earlier when Captain Gladson, as a teacher and sailor, witnessed the positive effect that the experience of sailing at sea had upon even his most challenged alternative school students, even those with dyslexia. The mission for LAMI‚Äôs new TopSail Youth Program would be to use sail training to provide youth with the real-life challenges that would develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to stay in school and become healthy, productive adults.

With less than $5,000 in donated funds and a one-room office in the depths of the Los Angeles Maritime Museum, they sought a suitable vessel for purchase. A short time later, a 70‚Äô schooner was purchased with the help of a loan from a local foundation.

LAMI soon started sailing with groups of adolescents as the TopSail Youth Program. Inspired by Captain Gladson‚Äôs dedication and vision, the loan from the foundation used to purchase the Institute‚Äôs first vessel was paid back in less than four years by hundreds of the program‚Äôs local supporters, many of whom witnessed firsthand, as volunteers, the positive results of this unique and nurturing program. In 1997, responding to the success of the program and the demand by a local youth agency for 260 additional sailing days, a second tall ship, a 95-foot schooner, was obtained.

In 2000, the TopSail Program had continued to demonstrate such notable success that LAMI began construction of two additional 110‚Äô tall ships, which were designed and built specifically to address the historical needs of the program. At their launch in April of 2002, Mayor James Hahn and the City Council proclaimed these state-of-the-art tall ships and their youth crews ‚ÄúThe Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles‚Äù.

In the 22 years since the Los Angeles Maritime Institute was founded, more than 55,000 young people from throughout Southern California have had the opportunity to directly benefit from participation in hands-on learning experiences through the TopSail Youth Program. LAMI continues to give ‚Äúreal life‚Äù context to subjects like science, mathematics, engineering, history, and literature, and to raise awareness about environmental impacts to our oceans and local waters.

&nbsp;

<em>Among the infinite array of factors and events that influence the course of a person‚Äôs life there are a few ‚Äúwindows of opportunity‚Äù that are particularly open to outside intervention. One of these is adolescence, that period when most youths first question and challenge authority, when newly discovered causes are most passionately embraced, and the human need for exploration and adventure is most easily fulfilled. That is, if you are growing up in an accepting, nurturing, loving, family and society that can afford the luxury of cultivating it‚Äôs next generation.</em>

Los Angeles Maritime Institute (LAMI) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that uses hands-on experiences at sea to provide an array of social, education and leadership development opportunities to middle school and high school students in San Pedro and Wilmington, and throughout the greater Los Angeles area. Our TopSail Youth Program is offered year-round aboard the Tall Ships<i>¬†Irving Johnson </i>and <i>Exy Johnson</i>, 110-foot traditionally rigged wooden vessels named after Adventure Learning pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. Our purpose-built vessels and their crews were proclaimed the "Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles" at their launch in 2002.

<strong>TopSail Youth Program</strong>

The award-winning TopSail Youth Program is an education and adventure experience aboard a tall ship consisting of day sails, voyages, or both.¬†Skills gained include team-building, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, self-reliance and leadership. Our unique learning environment exposes underserved and educationally disadvantaged youth to a world beyond their communities where they are provided with real-life challenges not available in the traditional classroom. Founded in 1992 by Captain Jim Gladson, we have served over 55,000 young people with transformational experiences at sea and changed the course for thousands of youth who were on a dropout path leading to gangs, drugs and crime.

<strong>Science at Sea</strong>

In the fall of 2013, we partnered with LAUSD's Office of Outdoor and Environmental Education to promote a cooperative learning atmosphere where students are encouraged to engage in the science inquiry process through experiential education in the natural world. Students build confidence and achieve a sense of accomplishment as they assume the role of the crew and sail the vessel.

<strong>STEM TopSail</strong>

In January 2015, we launched a Waterfront Education collaboration with King Harbor Boating Foundation. This project includes curriculum specifically designed to educate about the local Redondo Beach waters and ecosystems. The <em>Educator Classroom Program</em> will combine classroom education with at-sea learning activities, supporting the intentions of the Next Generation Science Standards. The customized educational experiences are designed to provide a teaching extension tool for educators allowing them to expose their students to learning in a natural environment, on the ocean aboard our tall ships.";s:10:"post_title";s:16:"Mission & Vision";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:14:"mission-vision";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-01-30 08:32:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-01-30 08:32:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:3:"626";s:4:"guid";s:32:"http://198.1.99.216/?page_id=589";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:13;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"578";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2014-11-01 23:42:53";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2014-11-01 23:42:53";s:12:"post_content";s:1462:"<a title="VOLUNTEER FORMS"><strong>VOLUNTEER FORMS</strong></a>

Our ‚ÄúSail Training Logbook‚Äù is your guide to a solid foundation, and will start you on a rewarding journey into the maritime world. Compiled by internationally renowned sail training expert, Captain Martyn Clark, the Logbook directs you through three levels of competence: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. Our policy with all activities for students is ‚Äúchallenge by choice,‚Äù and the same applies to our volunteer crew. You proceed through the levels at your own pace. Whether you prefer to go slowly, or move as quickly as you can, LAMI‚Äôs professional crew and staff are there with enthusiasm to support you.

We‚Äôll provide hands-on instruction in conjunction with the book. You‚Äôll become proficient in setting, handling, and taking in all sail, helming the vessel, tying lots of knots, navigating, watch standing, marlinspike seamanship, and, above all, safety procedures used in shipboard emergencies, such as a man overboard, fire, or abandon ship scenario.

Completion of the Junior level qualifies you as a LAMI ‚Äúdeckhand,‚Äù and rates you capable of joining our voyage crew. Finish all three levels and you‚Äôre likely ready to test for your 100 Ton US Coast Guard Master‚Äôs license.

Designated the ‚ÄúOfficial Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles‚Äù at their launch in 2002, these 110-foot wooden vessels are charged with giving tens of thousands of young people the opportunity to experience self-discovery, life changing adventure and education found only on a tall ship at sea.

Built to last 100 years, the state-of-the-art brigantine design is based on TopSail founder Jim Gladson‚Äôs decades of experience with adolescent education and youth sail training programs, years of valuable experience gained from the Institute‚Äôs first vessel, Swift of Ipswich, and discussions with sail training experts throughout the world.

Purpose-built by the Institute to meet or exceed all U.S. Coast Guard requirements, the brigantines are named in honor of the late Captain Irving and Electa ‚ÄúExy‚Äù Johnson, character-building sail training pioneers and seven-time circumnavigators with youth crew aboard their sailing vessel YANKEE.

<a title="Swift of the Ipswich"><strong>Swift of the Ipswich</strong></a>
The TopSail Youth Program‚Äôs original vessel, Swift of Ipswich, is a representation of a Revolutionary War privateer. She is a 70-foot wooden topsail schooner designed by Howard Chappelle and built in 1938 by William Robinson.

The Swift of Ipswich was once the personal yacht of actor James Cagney and had been a well-known floating landmark in California for over 60 years. Many who know her say her finest hours have been those spent serving youth.

About two thirds the size of one of our brigantines, ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù is especially well-suited for working with younger youth.

Our beloved Swift will be a sight to behold when she returns to San Pedro and will be charged with serving upper elementary and middle school students in Wilmington. You can <a href="http://jgsoto.smugmug.com/Swift-of-Ipswich-" target="_blank">follow the excellent photo record</a> of her reconstruction being created by Jerry Soto.

TopSail Youth Program is an education and adventure experience aboard a tall ship consisting of day sails, voyages, or both. ¬†Skills gained include team-building, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, self-reliance and leadership.

The program is offered aboard our twin brigantines, the <i>Exy Johnson</i> and <i>Irving Johnson</i>, traditionally rigged 110-foot wooden vessels and the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. ¬†The ships are docked at Berth 78 in San Pedro, California.

Our goal is to help youth develop the problem-solving skills and attitudes difficult to teach in the classroom, yet necessary to stay in school and become healthy, productive adults who better understand their responsibilities as involved and informed members of society. ¬†Youth are able to explore and gain an understanding of marine-related opportunities through ‚Äúhands-on" experiences during their time aboard our vessels. ¬†They raise and trim sails; stand lookout in the bow of a rolling ship; take the helm and steer the course they‚Äôve set; and even climb the rigging to furl sails standing only on footropes. ¬†Youth develop leadership and team building skills, which include personal values such as respect, patience, self-discipline, integrity and tenacity while being encouraged to explore and gain an understanding of the ocean and marine environments. ¬†Our program has a rich history of fostering environmental awareness, particularly Port-related environmental impacts, and inspiring young people to pursue maritime careers and marine science fields of study.

The TopSail Youth Program exposes at-risk and educationally disadvantaged youth to a world beyond their communities where they are provided with real-life challenges not available in the traditional classroom. ¬†Founded in 1992, we have served over 55,000 young people with transformational experiences at sea and changed the course for thousands of youth who were on a dropout path leading to gangs, drugs and crime.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Benefits of Experiential Learning at Sea</strong>

The sailing vessel provides an educational venue, rich in potential for the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are necessary for the education of today‚Äôs youth, but may be difficult for some youth to grasp in the classroom. It is effective with those youth who are not coping well with the demands of society and are ‚Äúat risk‚Äù of dropping out of school and/or giving up on the quest for a successful and productive life. Our educational program is coupled with a sailing experience to enrich, validate, challenge and enhance conventional school curricula. Science, mathematics, physics, biology, geography, history, and literature come to life in this real world, outdoor classroom. Students don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre engaged in a curricula learning environment or growth sequence of developing skills: Awareness, Understanding, Communication, Cooperation, and Teamwork. At the same time, the students‚Äô attitudes are able to mature in: Persistence, Patience, Endurance, Courage, and Caution. Our program offers ‚Äúreal life‚Äù experience in: problem solving, decision making, planning, self reliance, and leadership. Not only is this an impressive list of outcomes for any educational endeavor, it is demonstrably cost effective to achieve these goals with sailing vessels.

&nbsp;

<strong>Participants and Program Cost</strong>

During the 2013-2014 school year, the TopSail Youth Program provided at-sea learning experiences to more than 3,200 young people plus 460 teachers and/or chaperones from 39 different schools and youth organizations. Our volunteers logged over 20,000 hours. Our program‚Äôs primary focus is underserved youth in middle and high schools, 6th ‚Äì 12th grade, but is flexible enough that we can offer it to any school or organized youth group, regardless of income, race, ethnicity or social status. In 2014, we expanded our program to include upper elementary grades. We can adjust our program to fit the age or ability of any participant. It is also important that adult leaders accompanying the group are prepared to be active participants.

Our vessels can each accommodate up to 30 participants on overnight voyages and up to 35 participants on day sails. (A day sail is up to five hours at sea; an overnight voyage is up to 24 hours at sea.) Each year, through generous funding from the Port of Los Angeles, we are able to offer a ‚Äúfull scholarship‚Äù program to Title I schools and youth groups in low-income communities throughout Los Angeles, which means, there is no cost to participate in the program. However, due to the economic recession and Port budget cuts, starting with the 2014-2015 school year, the number of full scholarship programs has been reduced to 80 per year. These full scholarship programs are available on a first-come, first-served basis. In order to offset the reduction in full scholarship sails, a reduced program cost (partial scholarship) is offered to Title I schools and youth groups located in low-income communities at:¬†<strong>$1,190 for 3-hour day sail,</strong>¬†<strong>$1,750 for 5-hour day sail</strong>¬†and <strong>$3,500 for overnight voyage</strong>¬†(per night, full days). All groups are responsible for food and transportation to our dock, and other options are part of the planning discussion we have with each group. While we strive not to turn any group away for lack of funding, we can only continue to operate if each group pays what they can truly afford to offset the actual costs of our program. It costs us $4,400 per vessel per day to offer unique, life-changing experiences at sea - a small price to invest in our youth!

All other schools and youth groups (not Title I) can book our program at the following rates: <strong>$2,000 for 3-hour day sail, $2,500 for¬†</strong>¬†<strong>5-hour day sail </strong>and <strong>$5,000 for overnight voyage</strong>¬†(per night, full days); week voyages start at <strong>$20,000</strong>. These rates also apply to private charters and team building events. Since all income earned from program sails, private charters and public sailing events is used to support our scholarship programs for underserved youth, we ask that you consider adding a gratuity when booking our program or vessels. Thank you!

<strong>Sample Lessons within the TopSail Educational Environment</strong>

1) Speed/Time/Distance

Description: The correlation and interaction of these three forms of measurement are easily demonstrated and have real life meaning and application on a sailing vessel. First we begin with a tape measure and measure a section of the deck so that we have a known distance. Then we throw a biodegradable object such as a cracker over the side ahead of where our measurement on deck begins. Using a stopwatch we mark the time it takes the ‚Äúcracker‚Äù to travel between our known distance. This gives us a know time. All that‚Äôs left to do at this time is calculate the speed. We can then check the accuracy of our measurement against the ships electronics.

California State Standards:

Grade Eight ‚Äì Focus on Physical Science
Motion 1. b. Students know that average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time elapsed and that the speed of an object along the path traveled can vary. c. Students know how to solve problems involving distance, time, and average speed.
Grade Six-Algebra and Functions
2.3 Solve problems involving rates, average speed, distance, and time.

2) Mechanical Advantage

Description: Mechanical advantage plays an important part in raising sail on our vessels. We use block and tackle systems throughout the vessel. To illustrate this concept in a hands-on format we set the kids up to play tug of war with a block and tackle with a 4 to 1 mechanical advantage. Smaller kids stand on the side with the greater advantage with the larger kids opposite them. The smaller kids will dominate the exercise.
This concept can then be applied to calculate the force needed to raise various sails on the vessel with different known masses and mechanical advantage systems. For example, if the main sail has a mass of 800 pounds and a 4:1 mechanical advantage the students will determine that the force that they need to apply is 200 pounds.

California State Standards:

Grade Seven ‚Äì Focus on Life Science
Physical Principles in Living Systems (Physical Science) 6. i. Students know how levers confer mechanical advantage and how the application of this principle applies to the musculoskeletal system.
Grade Six- Number Sense
1.2 Interpret and use ratios in different contexts (e.g., batting averages, miles per hour) to show the relative sizes of two quantities, using appropriate notations (a/b, a to b, a:b).
