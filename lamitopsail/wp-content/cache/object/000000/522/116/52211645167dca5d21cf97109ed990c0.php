TopSail Youth Program is an education and adventure experience aboard a tall ship consisting of day sails, voyages, or both. ¬†Skills gained include team-building, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, self-reliance and leadership.

The program is offered aboard our twin brigantines, the <i>Exy Johnson</i> and <i>Irving Johnson</i>, traditionally rigged 110-foot wooden vessels and the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. ¬†The ships are docked at Berth 78 in San Pedro, California.

Our goal is to help youth develop the problem-solving skills and attitudes difficult to teach in the classroom, yet necessary to stay in school and become healthy, productive adults who better understand their responsibilities as involved and informed members of society. ¬†Youth are able to explore and gain an understanding of marine-related opportunities through ‚Äúhands-on" experiences during their time aboard our vessels. ¬†They raise and trim sails; stand lookout in the bow of a rolling ship; take the helm and steer the course they‚Äôve set; and even climb the rigging to furl sails standing only on footropes. ¬†Youth develop leadership and team building skills, which include personal values such as respect, patience, self-discipline, integrity and tenacity while being encouraged to explore and gain an understanding of the ocean and marine environments. ¬†Our program has a rich history of fostering environmental awareness, particularly Port-related environmental impacts, and inspiring young people to pursue maritime careers and marine science fields of study.

The TopSail Youth Program exposes at-risk and educationally disadvantaged youth to a world beyond their communities where they are provided with real-life challenges not available in the traditional classroom. ¬†Founded in 1992, we have served over 55,000 young people with transformational experiences at sea and changed the course for thousands of youth who were on a dropout path leading to gangs, drugs and crime.

<strong>The Benefits of Experiential Learning at Sea</strong>

The sailing vessel provides an educational venue, rich in potential for the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are necessary for the education of today‚Äôs youth, but may be difficult for some youth to grasp in the classroom. It is effective with those youth who are not coping well with the demands of society and are ‚Äúat risk‚Äù of dropping out of school and/or giving up on the quest for a successful and productive life. Our educational program is coupled with a sailing experience to enrich, validate, challenge and enhance conventional school curricula. Science, mathematics, physics, biology, geography, history, and literature come to life in this real world, outdoor classroom. Students don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre engaged in a curricula learning environment or growth sequence of developing skills: Awareness, Understanding, Communication, Cooperation, and Teamwork. At the same time, the students‚Äô attitudes are able to mature in: Persistence, Patience, Endurance, Courage, and Caution. Our program offers ‚Äúreal life‚Äù experience in: problem solving, decision making, planning, self reliance, and leadership. Not only is this an impressive list of outcomes for any educational endeavor, it is demonstrably cost effective to achieve these goals with sailing vessels.

<strong>Participants and Program Cost</strong>

During the 2013-2014 school year, the TopSail Youth Program provided at-sea learning experiences to more than 3,200 young people plus 460 teachers and/or chaperones from 39 different schools and youth organizations. Our volunteers logged over 20,000 hours. Our program‚Äôs primary focus is underserved youth in middle and high schools, 6th ‚Äì 12th grade, but is flexible enough that we can offer it to any school or organized youth group, regardless of income, race, ethnicity or social status. In 2014, we expanded our program to include upper elementary grades. We can adjust our program to fit the age or ability of any participant. It is also important that adult leaders accompanying the group are prepared to be active participants.

Our vessels can each accommodate up to 30 participants on overnight voyages and up to 35 participants on day sails. (A day sail is up to five hours at sea; an overnight voyage is up to 24 hours at sea.) Each year, through generous funding from the Port of Los Angeles, we are able to offer a ‚Äúfull scholarship‚Äù program to Title I schools and youth groups in low-income communities throughout Los Angeles, which means, there is no cost to participate in the program. However, due to the economic recession and Port budget cuts, starting with the 2014-2015 school year, the number of full scholarship programs has been reduced to 80 per year. These full scholarship programs are available on a first-come, first-served basis. In order to offset the reduction in full scholarship sails, a reduced program cost (partial scholarship) is offered to Title I schools and youth groups located in low-income communities at:¬†<strong>$1,190 for 3-hour day sail,</strong>¬†<strong>$1,750 for 5-hour day sail</strong>¬†and <strong>$3,500 for overnight voyage</strong>¬†(per night, full days). All groups are responsible for food and transportation to our dock, and other options are part of the planning discussion we have with each group. While we strive not to turn any group away for lack of funding, we can only continue to operate if each group pays what they can truly afford to offset the actual costs of our program. It costs us $4,400 per vessel per day to offer unique, life-changing experiences at sea - a small price to invest in our youth!

All other schools and youth groups (not Title I) can book our program at the following rates: <strong>$2,000 for 3-hour day sail, $2,500 for¬†</strong>¬†<strong>5-hour day sail </strong>and <strong>$5,000 for overnight voyage</strong>¬†(per night, full days); week voyages start at <strong>$20,000</strong>. These rates also apply to private charters and team building events. Since all income earned from program sails, private charters and public sailing events is used to support our scholarship programs for underserved youth, we ask that you consider adding a gratuity when booking our program or vessels. Thank you!

<strong>Sample Lessons within the TopSail Educational Environment</strong>

1) Speed/Time/Distance

Description: The correlation and interaction of these three forms of measurement are easily demonstrated and have real life meaning and application on a sailing vessel. First we begin with a tape measure and measure a section of the deck so that we have a known distance. Then we throw a biodegradable object such as a cracker over the side ahead of where our measurement on deck begins. Using a stopwatch we mark the time it takes the ‚Äúcracker‚Äù to travel between our known distance. This gives us a know time. All that‚Äôs left to do at this time is calculate the speed. We can then check the accuracy of our measurement against the ships electronics.

California State Standards:

Grade Eight ‚Äì Focus on Physical Science
Motion 1. b. Students know that average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time elapsed and that the speed of an object along the path traveled can vary. c. Students know how to solve problems involving distance, time, and average speed.
Grade Six-Algebra and Functions
2.3 Solve problems involving rates, average speed, distance, and time.

2) Mechanical Advantage

Description: Mechanical advantage plays an important part in raising sail on our vessels. We use block and tackle systems throughout the vessel. To illustrate this concept in a hands-on format we set the kids up to play tug of war with a block and tackle with a 4 to 1 mechanical advantage. Smaller kids stand on the side with the greater advantage with the larger kids opposite them. The smaller kids will dominate the exercise.
This concept can then be applied to calculate the force needed to raise various sails on the vessel with different known masses and mechanical advantage systems. For example, if the main sail has a mass of 800 pounds and a 4:1 mechanical advantage the students will determine that the force that they need to apply is 200 pounds.

California State Standards:

Grade Seven ‚Äì Focus on Life Science
Physical Principles in Living Systems (Physical Science) 6. i. Students know how levers confer mechanical advantage and how the application of this principle applies to the musculoskeletal system.
Grade Six- Number Sense
1.2 Interpret and use ratios in different contexts (e.g., batting averages, miles per hour) to show the relative sizes of two quantities, using appropriate notations (a/b, a to b, a:b).
