Initiative. Â Our TopSail S.T.E.M. Program builds on our signature TopSail Youth Program and leverages the S.T.E.M. framework inherent to our program. Â We're focusing on the "M" in S.T.E.M. (Mathematics) and working exclusively with Wilmington Middle School in order to expand our S.T.E.M. activities with the school's Science / Robotics program and College Core Curriculum program (CCC). Â We plan to serve approximately 240 students with this pilot program with a combination of in-classroom and at-sea learning activities. Â We will be using the Navigation component of our TopSail program to enhance students' interest in mathematics. Â Our Navigation curriculum is designed to teach students how to identify the symbols and data on a nautical chart. Â In this process they will be introduced to a nautical chart, its geometry Â and many of its symbols, then use that information to determine a course and relay it to a helmsman so that course can be steered. Â All of this work takes place in real-world scenarios aboard our tall ships. Â Each program participant will receive an interactive Student Logbook to aid their learning and track their progress.";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"TopSail S.T.E.M.
