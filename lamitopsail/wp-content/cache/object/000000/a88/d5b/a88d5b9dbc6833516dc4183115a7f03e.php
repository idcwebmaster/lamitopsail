In San Pedro take Harbor Blvd to 6th Street.Â  Turn east on 6th.Â  It dead ends at the Maritime Museum.Â  You can only turn right onto Sampson Way.Â  Follow Sampson into Ports oâ€™ Call Village.

Turn left on Nagoya Way into Ports oâ€™ Call Village and go to Berth 78. The sign for it is yellow and black, but itâ€™s a bit difficult to find.Â  Look instead for the San Pedro Fish Market.Â  Our dock is to the right of the Fish Market, and is visible across an open grass area.Â  Park near the grass area (itâ€™s free!) and take the sidewalk at the right side of the grass near the Candy Shop.Â  The sidewalk dead ends, then turns right.Â  Just beyond the turn, youâ€™ll find the gate to our dock on your left. DECK House is the second shop (#P-3) on your right.

Stay on Sampson Way past two stop signs â€“ Nagoya Way and Skytower Way.Â  At the third stop sign, youâ€™ll see an off-white, two-story building with a green stripe and signs for Utroâ€™s restaurant.Â  Turn left at that stop sign and follow the road around till you can turn right into the small parking lot by the restaurant.Â  Our office is in the top story of the building.Â  The door is past the front of the restaurant.

<ul>
	<li class="p1">Crew shirts are worn for all day sails, the first day of a voyage, and any time the vessel enters or leaves a port.</li>
	<li class="p1">Khaki, tan, or navy blue pants or shorts are preferred.Â  Jeans are ok, too.Â  Dirty, soiled, torn clothing is fine for maintenance days, but not for working with students.Â  Same goes for short shorts and tank tops or camisoles.</li>
	<li class="p1">Bathing suits are encouraged for voyages, but please be conscious of how revealing they are.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">Everything!Â  Setting and taking in sail, furling (folding and putting away sail), tending docklines, doing deck washes, cooking, cleaning (we all contribute), navigating, helming, working in the rig, sanding painting, putting protective pine tar on stays...Â  Any job on the boat is available to you, but above all, your task is to be a good shipmate and make anyone who comes aboard feel welcome and included.</p>

&nbsp;

<a title="Iâ€™m scared of heights."><strong>Iâ€™m scared of heights. Do I have to climb aloft?</strong></a>
<p class="p1">No.Â  Everything we do aloft in the rig is â€œchallenge by choice.â€Â  That option applies equally to volunteers and students.Â  (If you want to try, though, weâ€™re always ready to encourage you and help you do so safely.)</p>

&nbsp;

<a title="What if I get seasick?"><strong>What if I get seasick?</strong></a>
<p class="p1">There are many methods to prevent seasickness.Â  Dramamine, Bonine, Meclazine, and other over the counter anti-seasickness medications are available at local drug stores.Â  There also are patches to wear behind your ears and pressure point wristbands that help.</p>
<p title="p1">And thereâ€™s no shame in seasickness.Â  It happens to all of us.Â  Donâ€™t let it stop you from joining us.</p>

<a title="tall ship festivals"><strong>What are these â€œtall ship festivalsâ€ you talk about?</strong></a>
<p class="p1">Once a year, a group of tall ships get together in a few local ports â€“ LA, San Diego, and Dana Point are frequent stops.Â  We open to the public for tours and â€œbattle sailsâ€ (re-enactments of tactics from the Age of Sail).Â  These gatherings are a chance to interact with other sailors and show the public a part of our world.Â  Theyâ€™re a lot of work and a lot of fun.</p>
