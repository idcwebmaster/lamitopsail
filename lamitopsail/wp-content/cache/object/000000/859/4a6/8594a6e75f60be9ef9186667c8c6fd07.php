Designated the ‚ÄúOfficial Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles‚Äù at their launch in 2002, these 110-foot wooden vessels are charged with giving tens of thousands of young people the opportunity to experience self-discovery, life changing adventure and education found only on a tall ship at sea.

Built to last 100 years, the state-of-the-art brigantine design is based on TopSail founder Jim Gladson‚Äôs decades of experience with adolescent education and youth sail training programs, years of valuable experience gained from the Institute‚Äôs first vessel, Swift of Ipswich, and discussions with sail training experts throughout the world.

Purpose-built by the Institute to meet or exceed all U.S. Coast Guard requirements, the brigantines are named in honor of the late Captain Irving and Electa ‚ÄúExy‚Äù Johnson, character-building sail training pioneers and seven-time circumnavigators with youth crew aboard their sailing vessel YANKEE.

The TopSail Youth Program‚Äôs original vessel, Swift of Ipswich, is a representation of a Revolutionary War privateer. She is a 70-foot wooden topsail schooner designed by Howard Chappelle and built in 1938 by William Robinson.

The Swift of Ipswich was once the personal yacht of actor James Cagney and had been a well-known floating landmark in California for over 60 years. Many who know her say her finest hours have been those spent serving youth.

About two thirds the size of one of our brigantines, ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù is especially well-suited for working with younger youth.

Our beloved Swift will be a sight to behold when she returns to San Pedro and will be charged with serving upper elementary and middle school students in Wilmington. You can <a href="http://jgsoto.smugmug.com/Swift-of-Ipswich-" target="_blank">follow the excellent photo record</a> of her reconstruction being created by Jerry Soto.
