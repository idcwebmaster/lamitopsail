Los Angeles Maritime Institute (LAMI) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that uses hands-on experiences at sea to provide an array of social, education and leadership development opportunities to middle school and high school students in San Pedro and Wilmington, and throughout the greater Los Angeles area. Our TopSail Youth Program is offered year-round aboard the Tall Ships<i>Â Irving Johnson </i>and <i>Exy Johnson</i>, 110-foot traditionally rigged wooden vessels named after Adventure Learning pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. Our purpose-built vessels and their crews were proclaimed the "Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles" at their launch in 2002.

<strong>TopSail Youth Program</strong>

The award-winning TopSail Youth Program is an education and adventure experience aboard a tall ship consisting of day sails, voyages, or both.Â Skills gained include team-building, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, self-reliance and leadership. Our unique learning environment exposes underserved and educationally disadvantaged youth to a world beyond their communities where they are provided with real-life challenges not available in the traditional classroom. Founded in 1992 by Captain Jim Gladson, we have served over 55,000 young people with transformational experiences at sea and changed the course for thousands of youth who were on a dropout path leading to gangs, drugs and crime.

<strong>Science at Sea</strong>

In the fall of 2013, we partnered with LAUSD's Office of Outdoor and Environmental Education to promote a cooperative learning atmosphere where students are encouraged to engage in the science inquiry process through experiential education in the natural world. Students build confidence and achieve a sense of accomplishment as they assume the role of the crew and sail the vessel.

<strong>STEM TopSail</strong>

In January 2015, we launched a Waterfront Education collaboration with King Harbor Boating Foundation. This project includes curriculum specifically designed to educate about the local Redondo Beach waters and ecosystems. The <em>Educator Classroom Program</em> will combine classroom education with at-sea learning activities, supporting the intentions of the Next Generation Science Standards. The customized educational experiences are designed to provide a teaching extension tool for educators allowing them to expose their students to learning in a natural environment, on the ocean aboard our tall ships.";s:10:"post_title";s:16:"Mission & Vision";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:14:"mission-vision";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-01-30 08:32:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-01-30 08:32:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:626;s:4:"guid";s:32:"http://198.1.99.216/?page_id=589";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
