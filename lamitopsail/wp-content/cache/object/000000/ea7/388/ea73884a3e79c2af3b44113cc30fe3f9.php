Los Angeles Maritime Institute is an extraordinary place. The opportunities we provide for volunteers are nearly endless.

<em>Never sailed before?</em> No problem. Weâ€™ll teach you.

<em>Have a ton of sailing experience?</em> Great! Come add to it and put your skills to the test in a very different environment.

<em>Enjoy working with kids?</em> Excellent. Youâ€™ll thrive with us.

<em>Convinced kids are not your calling?</em> Give us a chance. Weâ€™ll show you how satisfying putting others first can be.

<em>Think sailing might not be for you?</em> Our at-sea operations require a lot of dockside support, and we always need help with them. There is constant demand in the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>General boat maintenance â€“ sanding, oiling, painting, cleaning the vessels</li>
	<li>Canvas/sail repair</li>
	<li>Carpentry</li>
	<li>Marine Diesel maintenance</li>
	<li>Electrical systems maintenance</li>
	<li>Plumbing</li>
	<li>Fundraising</li>
	<li>Grant writing</li>
	<li>Office projects</li>
	<li>Web design</li>
	<li>Food preparation</li>
	<li>Retail/sales</li>
</ul>
â€¦and much more! If you have the knowledge or desire to learn, we have a place for you.

The bottom line is â€“ the only thing necessary to succeed and have a truly rewarding experience with us is time and a willing attitude.
