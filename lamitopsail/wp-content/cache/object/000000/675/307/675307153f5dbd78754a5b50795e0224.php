Youth who have participated in the TopSail Program, either with their schools, Scout or Guide groups, churches or other young people‚Äôs organizations, are invited to return on weekends or ‚Äúafter hours‚Äù to develop their skills and nourish the sense of empowerment that they first discovered aboard ship. We also welcome those from the community we serve, even if they were not previously involved in formal programs. A schedule of instruction and ‚Äúhands on‚Äù participation sailing one of LAMI‚Äôs tall ships is offered on a regular basis. As members of the this crew, youth are able to develop their maritime skills, and are invited to return to sail with the adult volunteer crew for weekend day sails and even longer voyages.
