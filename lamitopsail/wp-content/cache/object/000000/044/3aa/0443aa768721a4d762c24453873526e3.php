Los Angeles Maritime Institute has joined #GivingTuesday, a first of its kind effort that will harness the collective power of a unique blend of partnersâ€”charities, families, businesses and individualsâ€”to transform how people think about, talk about and participate in the giving season. Coinciding with the Thanksgiving Holiday and the kickoff of the holiday shopping season, #GivingTuesday will inspire people to take collaborative action to improve their local communities, give back in better, smarter ways to the charities and causes they support and help create a better world. Taking place December 2, 2014 â€“ the Tuesday after Thanksgiving â€“ #GivingTuesday will harness the power of social media to create a national moment around the holidays dedicated to giving, similar to how Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become days that are, today, synonymous with holiday shopping.

We invite you to join the #GivingTuesday movement on December 2 and support Los Angeles Maritime Institute which, in turn, will help us serve the youth in our communities with life-changing experiences at sea. There are a number of ways you can give:
