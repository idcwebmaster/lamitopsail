Our ‚ÄúSail Training Logbook‚Äù is your guide to a solid foundation, and will start you on a rewarding journey into the maritime world. Compiled by internationally renowned sail training expert, Captain Martyn Clark, the Logbook directs you through three levels of competence: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. Our policy with all activities for students is ‚Äúchallenge by choice,‚Äù and the same applies to our volunteer crew. You proceed through the levels at your own pace. Whether you prefer to go slowly, or move as quickly as you can, LAMI‚Äôs professional crew and staff are there with enthusiasm to support you.

We‚Äôll provide hands-on instruction in conjunction with the book. You‚Äôll become proficient in setting, handling, and taking in all sail, helming the vessel, tying lots of knots, navigating, watch standing, marlinspike seamanship, and, above all, safety procedures used in shipboard emergencies, such as a man overboard, fire, or abandon ship scenario.

Completion of the Junior level qualifies you as a LAMI ‚Äúdeckhand,‚Äù and rates you capable of joining our voyage crew. Finish all three levels and you‚Äôre likely ready to test for your 100 Ton US Coast Guard Master‚Äôs license.
